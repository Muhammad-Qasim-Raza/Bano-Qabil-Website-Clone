Bano Qabil Website Clone

Description: This is a clone of the Bano Qabil website's home page and navbar. The navbar contains links to four sections: Courses, Contact Us, Campus Selection/Admission, and Schedule.
The Courses and Contact Us links are functional and lead to their respective sections on the home page. These sections have been linked to the navbar for easy access.
This clone has been created using HTML and CSS (I used inline CSS to style the elements of the page.) only, with no external frameworks or libraries. The design mimics the original website's layout and color scheme.
Overall, this clone serves as a great example of how to create a simple, yet functional website using basic web technologies. With a few tweaks and additions, it can easily be customized to fit any specific needs or requirements.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. This means it can be easily accessed and viewed online. If you would like to preview my Architect-Template-Clone-Responsive website, you can do so by clicking on the following link: https://muhammad-qasim-raza.github.io/Bano-Qabil-Website-Clone/.
