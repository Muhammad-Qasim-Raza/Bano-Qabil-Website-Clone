Bano Qabil Website Clone

The Courses and Contact Us links are functional and lead to their respective sections on the home page. These sections have been linked to the navbar for easy access.
This clone has been created using HTML and CSS only, with no external frameworks or libraries. The design mimics the original website's layout and color scheme.

Overall, this clone serves as a great example of how to create a simple, yet functional website using basic web technologies. With a few tweaks and additions, it can easily be customized to fit any specific needs or requirements.
